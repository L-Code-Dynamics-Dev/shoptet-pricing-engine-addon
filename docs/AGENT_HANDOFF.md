# L-Code Loyalty Pricing Engine — shared agent handoff

This is the shared coordination log for Gemini 3.8 Flash Medium (implementation) and GPT-6 (independent review). Source of truth for implemented behavior is the actual code and test output, not this log. Never paste secrets, OAuth codes or customer data.

## Working agreement
- Gemini owns implementation changes on its own isolated branch. GPT-6 reviews commits/PRs and updates this handoff on a separate coordination branch; no concurrent edits to implementation files.
- Each entry must include UTC timestamp, agent, branch, commit SHA, scope, changed paths, exact test command/result, risks, next owner and next action.
- Do not claim PASS from an earlier report. Distinguish REPORT, VERIFIED, BLOCKED, REVIEWED and DONE.
- Before edits: read relevant installed skills (context-engineering, using-agent-skills, incremental-implementation, code-simplification, test-driven-development, debugging-and-error-recovery, graphify, okfish-pricing-engine), then targeted source ranges. Skills guide workflow but current code controls truth.
- Workflow: specification -> failing test -> minimal patch -> targeted test -> full regression -> review -> checkpoint. No live price writes, migrations or deployment without explicit approval.
- If branches diverge, do not overwrite entries; reconcile with a PR.

## Transfer phases
| Phase | Owner | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Decimal pricing core | Gemini | NOT VERIFIED | Pending commit and targeted tests |
| Coupon domain (percent-ceiling/fixed-amount, locks, minPriceRatio) | Gemini | NOT VERIFIED | Pending commit and targeted tests |
| Price and coupon reconciliation (read-only, coverage self-check) | Gemini | NOT VERIFIED | Pending commit and targeted tests |
| Independent review | GPT-6 | PENDING | Review only after SHA/PR is supplied or visible |

## Checkpoints
### 2026-11-07 — GPT-6 — initial coordination
- Repository: `L-Code-Dynamics-Dev/shoptet-pricing-engine-addon`.
- Baseline observed via GitHub commit search: `a16bcbe780d1470cf57b7087867dbbfa82c2952f`; this is a snapshot, not a claim that Gemini's worktree matches it.
- User/Gemini report: 244/244 tests passed; `TRANSFER_RULES.md` present; Worker running. These are **reported, not independently executed** by GPT-6.
- Next Gemini action: append a checkpoint for each finished slice with commit SHA, tests, paths, outstanding issues. Use a PR to bring this coordination document to the shared branch if needed.
- Next GPT-6 action: scheduled periodic GitHub status check; compare commits/PRs and update handoff with independently verified facts only.
